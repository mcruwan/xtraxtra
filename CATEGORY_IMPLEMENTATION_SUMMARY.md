- `news_submission_category` (pivot table)

### No Migration Needed
✅ All database tables and relationships already exist!
✅ Just needed the admin interface to manage them!

### Model Relationships
```php
// Category Model
public function newsSubmissions(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(NewsSubmission::class, 'news_submission_category');
}

// NewsSubmission Model (already exists)
public function categories(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Category::class, 'news_submission_category');
}
```

## 📍 Where to Find It

### Admin Navigation
```
Dashboard 
  └─ News Categories (NEW!)
      ├─ List all categories
      ├─ Add new category
      ├─ Edit existing
      └─ View details
```

### Direct URLs
- List: `http://yoursite.com/admin/categories`
- Create: `http://yoursite.com/admin/categories/create`
- Show: `http://yoursite.com/admin/categories/{id}`
- Edit: `http://yoursite.com/admin/categories/{id}/edit`

## 🚀 How to Use (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create Categories
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to `/admin/categories`
3. Click "Add New Category"
4. Enter category name (e.g., "Student Awards")
5. Description helps universities understand the category
6. Click "Create Category"

### Step 2: Universities See Categories
When university creates article:
1. They see all your categories in a checkboxes list
2. They can select multiple categories for one article
3. Categories appear in alphabetical order

### Step 3: Manage Over Time
- Edit categories to improve descriptions
- Delete unused categories (if no articles)
- Search/filter to organize better

- Alumni Success
- Partnerships
- Awards & Recognition

You can add, edit, or delete these!

- Slug auto-generates: "research-innovation"
- Slug used in URLs and API calls

### Search Functionality
- Search by name: "research"
- Search by slug: "research-innovation"
- Search by description: "breakthroughs"

### Statistics Dashboard

## 🔗 Integration with Existing System

### How It Connects
1. **Universities create articles** → Select from your categories
2. **Categories are many-to-many** → One article can be in multiple categories
3. **Admin manages categories** → YOU control what's available
4. **News admin dashboard** → Could filter by category (future enhancement)

### No Breaking Changes
✅ Existing articles keep their categories
✅ University article form already shows categories
✅ All relationships already exist
✅ Just added the admin management interface

## 📋 Validation Rules Summary

| Field | Rules |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Required, unique, max 100 chars |
| Slug | Optional, unique, alphanumeric + hyphens only, max 100 chars |
| Description | Optional, max 1000 chars |

## 🎓 For Different Users

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
