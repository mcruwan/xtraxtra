2. Fill in the category name (required)
3. Optionally:
   - Enter a custom URL slug (or it will auto-generate)
   - Add a description to guide universities
4. Click **"Create Category"**

**Example Category:**
- Name: "Research & Innovation"
- Slug: "research-innovation" (auto-generated)
- Description: "Research breakthroughs, grants, and innovative projects"

### Editing a Category

2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon or click on the category name
3. Update the details
4. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Viewing Category Details

1. Click on the category name or the **View** (eye) icon

   - Category information
   - Number of associated articles
   - Number of published articles
   - Recent articles in this category
3. From here, you can edit or delete the category

**Important:** Categories can only be deleted if they have NO associated articles.

1. Click the **Delete** (trash) icon next to the category, OR
2. View the category details and click **"Delete Category"** button

## How Universities Use Categories

When universities submit news articles:

1. Navigate to **Create News Submission**
2. Scroll to the **Categories** section
3. See all available categories with descriptions
4. Select one or more categories that apply to the article
5. Submit the article

**Note:** Categories are displayed in alphabetical order for universities.

## Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate what content belongs in each category
   - ✅ Good: "Academic News", "Student Life", "Events & Conferences"
   - ❌ Bad: "News", "Info", "Misc"

2. **Helpful Descriptions**: Always add descriptions to guide universities
   - Example: "News related to academic programs, courses, and curriculum updates"

3. **Avoid Overlapping**: While multiple categories per article is allowed, try to keep categories distinct
   - Good: "Research & Innovation" vs "Student Life"
   - Bad: "News" and "Information"

4. **Consistent Slugs**: Slugs are auto-generated, but ensure they're readable
   - Good: "research-innovation"
   - Bad: "res-innov"

5. **Regular Maintenance**: 
   - Review and delete unused categories periodically
   - Ensure descriptions remain accurate
   - Update category names if they become obsolete

### For Database Management

- The `news_submission_category` pivot table automatically handles many-to-many relationships
- Deleting a category automatically removes its associations
- Deleting an article automatically removes its category associations

## Validation Rules

### Category Name
- Required
- String (text)
- Maximum 100 characters
- Must be unique
- Cannot be duplicated

### URL Slug
- Optional (auto-generated if empty)
- String (text)
- Maximum 100 characters
- Format: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Must be unique
- Regex pattern: `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`

### Description
- Optional
- String (text)
- Maximum 1000 characters

## API Integration

### Seed Data

Initial categories are seeded via `database/seeders/CategorySeeder.php`:

```php
$categories = [
    ['name' => 'Academic News', 'slug' => 'academic-news', ...],
    ['name' => 'Research & Innovation', 'slug' => 'research-innovation', ...],
    ['name' => 'Student Life', 'slug' => 'student-life', ...],
    // ... more categories
];
```

To seed categories:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=CategorySeeder
```

### Queries

**Get all categories:**
```php
$categories = Category::all();
```

**Get categories with article count:**
```php
$categories = Category::withCount('newsSubmissions')->get();
```

**Get articles in a category:**
```php
$articles = $category->newsSubmissions()->get();
```

**Get categories for an article:**
```php
$categories = $article->categories()->get();
```

## Security

### Authorization

- Only admin and super-admin users can manage categories
- Checked via `CategoryFormRequest::authorize()` method
- Enforced by `admin` middleware on routes

### Validation

- All input is validated via `CategoryFormRequest`
- Category names must be unique
- Slugs must follow proper format
- Descriptions limited to 1000 characters
- Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks

### Data Protection

- Cannot delete categories with associated articles
- Prevents orphaned relationships
- Maintains data integrity

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot delete a category

**Cause**: The category has associated articles

**Solution**: 
1. Edit articles to remove this category or assign different categories
2. Once all articles are reassigned, delete the category

### Issue: Slug is not auto-generating

**Cause**: Slug field already has a value

**Solution**:
1. Clear the slug field
2. When you leave the name field, the slug will auto-generate

### Issue: Categories not appearing in university form

**Cause**: Categories haven't been created yet, or application needs cache clear

**Solution**:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Category Icons/Colors**: Add visual indicators for categories
2. **Subcategories**: Support nested category hierarchies
3. **Category Analytics**: Track which categories have most articles
4. **Bulk Upload**: Import categories from CSV
5. **Category Templates**: Pre-defined category sets for different university types
6. **Auto-Assignment**: Automatically suggest categories based on article content
