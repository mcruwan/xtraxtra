# Support Ticketing System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete internal support ticketing/messaging system has been implemented to enable communication between universities and admins. This replaces the need for email communication for issues, bugs, and general support.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- **tickets** table: Stores ticket information including subject, description, status, priority, category, assignment, and timestamps
- **ticket_messages** table: Stores all messages/replies for each ticket, including internal notes for admins

### 2. University Features
Universities can now:
- **Create Support Tickets** with:
  - Subject and detailed description
  - Category selection (News Article, Bug Report, Feature Request, General, Other)
  - Priority level (Low, Medium, High)
  
- **View All Their Tickets** with:
  - Status filtering (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
  - Priority filtering
  - Category filtering
  - Search functionality
  - Statistics dashboard showing ticket counts by status
  
- **Manage Tickets**:
  - View full conversation history
  - Reply to tickets
  - Close resolved tickets

### 3. Admin Features
Admins can now:
- **View All Tickets** from all universities with:
  - Comprehensive filtering (status, priority, category, university, assigned admin)
  - Search functionality
  - Quick status overview tabs
  
- **Manage Tickets**:
  - View full conversation with all replies

### 4. Ticket Statuses
- **Open**: New ticket waiting for response
- **In Progress**: Admin is working on the issue
- **Resolved**: Issue has been fixed
- **Closed**: Ticket is closed (reopens automatically if university replies)

### 5. Priority Levels
- **Low**: General questions or minor issues
- **Medium**: Important but not urgent (default)
- **High**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention

### 6. Categories
- **News Article**: Issues related to news submissions
- **Bug Report**: System bugs and errors
- **Feature Request**: New feature suggestions
- **General**: General inquiries
- **Other**: Miscellaneous issues

## User Interface

## Technical Implementation

### Models
- `Ticket`: Main ticket model with relationships and scopes

- Both models include proper relationships to User and University models

### Controllers

### Authorization
- `TicketPolicy`: Controls access based on user roles and ticket ownership
- Universities can only access their own tickets
- Admins can access all tickets

### Routes
All routes are properly namespaced and protected:
- `university.tickets.*` routes for university users
- `admin.tickets.*` routes for admin users

### Views
Beautiful, responsive interfaces using Tailwind CSS and Flowbite components:
- Ticket listing pages with filters and search
- Ticket creation forms with validation
- Conversation views with message threading
- Reply forms and status management panels
