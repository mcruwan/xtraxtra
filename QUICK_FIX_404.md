# ⚡ Quick Fix: 404 CSS/JS Error

## The Problem
```
app-C2rjbO7F.css:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## ✅ Solution: Build Before Push (Current Setup)

**Since your server doesn't have Node.js, we build assets locally and commit them to git.**

### On Your Local Machine (Before Pushing):

**Option 1: Use the automated script (Recommended)**
```batch
build-and-push.bat
```

**Option 2: Manual steps**
```bash
npm run build
git add .gitignore public/build/
git commit -m "Build assets for production"
git push
```

### On Your Server (After Pulling):

**Just pull and clear caches:**
```bash
git pull origin ruwan-win
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

**No need to run `npm run build` on the server!** The built files are already in git.

---

## Why This Works

- ✅ `public/build/` is now committed to git (removed from `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Built files are included in every push
- ✅ Server just needs to pull code - no Node.js required
- ✅ Laravel finds the built files immediately

---

## Alternative Solution (If Server Has Node.js)

If your server had Node.js installed, you could:
- Keep `public/build/` in `.gitignore`
- Build on server after pulling code

But since your server doesn't have Node.js, **building before push is the better approach!**

---

## Quick Reference

**Before pushing code:**
```batch
build-and-push.bat
```

**On server after pulling:**
```bash
git pull && php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear && php artisan view:clear
```
