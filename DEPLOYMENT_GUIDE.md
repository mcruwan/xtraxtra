# Flowbite Deployment Guide for Live Server

This guide explains how to properly deploy your Laravel application with Flowbite to a live production server.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Fix for 404 CSS/JS Errors

**Every time you push code to git and deploy, you MUST rebuild assets on your server!**

### The Problem
When you see this error:
```
app-C2rjbO7F.css:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

This happens because:
- Your code references built assets via `manifest.json`
- But `public/build/` is in `.gitignore` (not committed)
- The built files don't exist on your server

### The Solution ‚ö°
**Run this on your server after EVERY git pull:**

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Or use the automated script:
```bash
bash deploy-server.sh  # Linux/Mac
# OR
deploy-server.bat      # Windows
```

**See `POST_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for the complete checklist.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Why Your Live Server Might Not Be Working

When you install npm packages (like Flowbite) in development, they are **not automatically included** in your production build. You need to:

1. **Build the assets** for production
2. **Run npm install and build** on the server after every deployment (recommended)
3. **Never commit** `public/build/` to git (it's in .gitignore)

## üöÄ Correct Deployment Process

### Option 1: Build on Server (Recommended ‚≠ê)

**This is the recommended approach and prevents the 404 error!**

**On your live server:**

Use the automated script:
```bash
bash deploy-server.sh  # Linux/Mac
# OR
deploy-server.bat      # Windows
```

Or manually:
1. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Pull latest code**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main  # or your branch name
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your server!

4. **Build assets for production** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - DO THIS EVERY TIME!**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Set proper permissions** (if needed):
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 public/build
   ```

6. **Clear Laravel caches**:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

### Option 2: Build Locally and Upload (Alternative)

**On your live server:**

1. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Pull latest code**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main  # or your branch name
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your server!

4. **Build assets for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Set proper permissions** (if needed):
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 public/build
   ```

6. **Clear Laravel caches**:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

## üìã What Gets Built

When you run `npm run build`, Vite will:
- ‚úÖ Compile your CSS (`resources/css/app.css`) including Tailwind and Flowbite styles
- ‚úÖ Compile your JavaScript (`resources/js/app.js`) including Flowbite initialization
- ‚úÖ Create optimized, minified files in `public/build/assets/`
- ‚úÖ Generate a `public/build/manifest.json` that Laravel uses to find the correct asset files

## üîç Verifying the Deployment

1. **Check that files exist on server**:
   - `public/build/manifest.json` should exist
   - `public/build/assets/` should contain `.css` and `.js` files

2. **Check browser console**:
   - Open your live site
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Check the Console tab for any 404 errors (missing CSS/JS files)
   - Check the Network tab to see if CSS/JS files are loading correctly

3. **Verify Flowbite is working**:
   - Visit a page with Flowbite components
   - Check if styles are applied
   - Test interactive components (dropdowns, modals)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: CSS/JS files return 404 ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST COMMON ISSUE

**Symptoms:**
```
app-C2rjbO7F.css:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

**Root Cause:**
- `public/build/` is in `.gitignore` (not committed to git)
- After pulling code, the build files don't exist on the server
- Laravel's `@vite()` directive looks for files that aren't there

**Solution:**
1. **Run on your server after EVERY git pull:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la public/build/manifest.json
   ls -la public/build/assets/
   ```

3. **Check file permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 public/build
   ```

4. **Clear Laravel caches:**
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

5. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

**Prevention:** Always run `npm run build` on your server after pulling code. Use `deploy-server.sh` or `deploy-server.bat` to automate this process.

### Problem: Flowbite styles not showing

**Solution:**
- Make sure Flowbite is in `package.json` dependencies
- Verify `tailwind.config.js` includes Flowbite plugin
- Check that `resources/js/app.js` imports Flowbite
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Problem: Interactive components (dropdowns, modals) not working

**Solution:**
- Make sure `resources/js/app.js` includes `import 'flowbite';`
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Problem: "Module not found" errors on server

**Solution:**
- Make sure you ran `npm install` on the server
- Verify Node.js version matches your local development environment
- Check `package.json` exists and has correct dependencies

## üìù Quick Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] `package.json` includes `flowbite` in dependencies
- [ ] `tailwind.config.js` includes Flowbite plugin
- [ ] `resources/js/app.js` imports Flowbite
- [ ] `resources/css/app.css` includes Tailwind directives
- [ ] `npm install` has been run
- [ ] `npm run build` has been run
- [ ] `public/build/` directory exists with files
- [ ] `public/build/manifest.json` exists
- [ ] Files are committed to git (or uploaded to server)

## üåê Server Requirements

Your live server needs:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Laravel** environment properly configured
- Write permissions for `public/build/` directory

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Add to .gitignore?** 
   - Some teams ignore `public/build/` and build on server
   - Others commit it for easier deployment
   - Both work, choose what fits your workflow

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Automate building with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
   - Build assets as part of your deployment process

3. **Cache Busting:**
   - Vite automatically generates unique filenames
   - `manifest.json` ensures Laravel uses the correct version
   - No need to manually clear browser cache
