# Git Commands to Push Build Files

## ✅ What's Ready

The build assets have been staged and are ready to commit:
- ✅ `public/build/manifest.json` (updated)
- ✅ `public/build/assets/app-DQxXB0lw.css` (new build)
- ✅ `public/build/assets/app-DjQP7RY9.js` (new build)
- ✅ `resources/js/app.js` (includes Flowbite import)

## 🚀 Commands to Run

**Option 1: Commit everything staged (recommended)**
```bash
git commit -m "Add production build assets with Flowbite integration"
git push
```

**Option 2: Commit with more details**
```bash
git commit -m "Build production assets and add Flowbite JS import

- Rebuilt CSS and JS assets for production
- Added Flowbite JavaScript import to app.js
- Includes manifest.json with updated file references"
git push
```

## 📥 On Your Live Server

After pushing, on your live server run:
```bash
git pull
```

That's it! The build files will now be on your server and the 404 error should be fixed.

## 📝 What Happens Next Time?

For future deployments, you have two choices:

1. **Build on server** (recommended):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Temporarily include build in git** (like we did now):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   git add -f public/build/
   git commit -m "Update production assets"
   git push
   ```

## ⚠️ Note

These files were force-added using `git add -f` because `/public/build` is in `.gitignore`. This is fine for a one-time deployment, but in the future you may want to:
- Build directly on the server, OR
- Remove `/public/build` from `.gitignore` if you prefer to commit builds
